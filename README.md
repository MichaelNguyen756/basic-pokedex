## Features

This basic Pokedex was built in the mindset of a player who is going through Pokemon Red or Blue in mind. Currently listed are the first 151 Pokemon (including the normally inaccessible Pokemon, Mew).
Choosing a Pokemon name will show you what the Pokemon looks like, the type, basic statistics when it starts at Level 1, and a moveset that the Pokemon will gain as it gains levels.
